6 Large King Edward potatoes (or similar variety)
1 Large Onion
2-3 cloves of garlic (optional)
Salt and pepper 
6 Eggs
1 "glug" of milk (large splash)

Serves 2-6 people, depending on hunger.

Cube the potatoes into half-inch/1.5cm cubes.
Chunkily dice the onions, you don't need to go very fine.
Heat approximately a litre of olive oil on a medim heat, and then gently soften everything.
Drain everything from the oil into a bowl. set aside to cool slightly while preparing the eggs.
Get a reasonably deep 8 or 9 inch frying pan, and heat a tablespoon of the oil in it.
Add the potatoes and onions, spread them all out and then pour the egg mix over them all.
Turn the heat down low, to cook the egg until the bottom is solid, but doesn't stick or burn.
Gently shake the pan in a circular motion to ensure the tortilla doesn't stick.
When you can see the tortilla is solid enough to be removed, plate a plate over the top, and invert the pan to remove the tortilla.
Using a second plate, invert the tortilla once more, replace the pan over it and invert one last time to return it to the pan.
Continue to cook until finished.
Serve warm or leave to cool (after a night in the fridge, it's amazing, and can be reheated in the microwave).
